# üìù EOF and BOM

## Substitute character

The [substitute character](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substitute_character)
(`CTRL-Z`)
[stops file streams](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/reference/read?view=vs-2017#remarks)
on some Windows commands when in text mode. This includes the
[`type` command](https://ss64.com/nt/type.html) in `cmd.exe`.

As a consequence that character should be avoided in non-binary files.

## End Of File

As opposed to Windows, Unix
[requires text files](http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/basedefs/V1_chap03.html#tag_03_206)
to end with a [newline character](newlines.md).

However please remember that Windows might print these as if two newlines were
present instead.

## Byte Order Mark

The [BOM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_order_mark) is a special character
at the beginning of a file indicating its
[endianness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness) and
[character encoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_encoding).

Since it creates issues with
[shebangs](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_(Unix)>) and adds little value
to [UTF-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8), it is better not to add it to
new files. However if a BOM is present in input, it should be properly handled.
Fortunately this is the default behavior of Node.js core methods, so this should
usually not create any issues.

## Linting

Character encoding, newlines and EOF behavior should be specified with
[editorconfig](https://editorconfig.org/). They can also be enforced with tools
like [ESLint](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/eol-last) and
[Prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier).

## Summary

Avoid the
[substitute character](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substitute_character)
(`CTRL-Z`) in non-binary files.

End files with a newline.

Use [editorconfig](https://editorconfig.org/).
